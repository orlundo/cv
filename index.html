    <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong>Mom Work's</strong></em></p>
    <p>Jesus is King! I'm the founder and CEO of Mom Work's. Mom Work's is an app built for stay at home mom's that are
      looking for flexible work while being
      able maintain their daily task at home. Being a stay at home mom can be hard work. I know this because my wife is a
      stay at home mom and there are so many
      things that she takes care of on a daily basis that doesn't seem big, but as we all know, it's the little things that
      matter. This app allows her to be a stay
      at home mom while also finding gainful employment that's flexible and able to work around her task at home. </p></td>
